# MERN Stack Starter Pack

Welcome to the MERN Stack Starter Pack! This repository provides a pre-configured setup for building applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). By cloning this repository, you can quickly set up your development environment and start building your application with a well-structured directory layout.

## Directory Structure

```
Starter-pack/
├── client/
└── server/
    ├── models/
    ├── routes/
    ├── controllers/
    ├── middlewares/
    ├── config/
    └── utils/
```

### `client/`

This folder contains the frontend application built with React.js.

### `server/`

This folder contains the backend application built with Node.js and Express.js. The structure is as follows:

- **`models/`**: Contains Mongoose models for the application.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route handlers for different API endpoints.
- **`controllers/`**: Contains the business logic for handling requests and responses.
- **`middlewares/`**: Contains middleware functions for authentication, authorization, etc.
- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files, including database connection settings.
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions used across the application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the MERN stack starter pack:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shoaibxaif/starter-pack.git
    cd starter-pack
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies for Server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies for Client:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```

5. **Start the Client:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

   The client will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Frontend:** Modify the React components in the `client/` folder to build your user interface.
- **Backend:** Modify the server-side logic in the `server/` folder to implement your application's business logic.
